Features (with build order)

Cross-site Policy Monitor (MVP)

Track official policy/news pages per platform (see sources below).

Diff & summarize changes; tag severity & category (fees / prohibited items / shipping / data / ads).

AI: small LLM to summarize diffs into seller-friendly bullets; rule-based tagging to start.

Checklists & Acknowledgments

Per change, attach an actionable checklist.

Acknowledge → moves to audit trail (CSV/PDF export for agencies).

Impact Estimator (lightweight)

If shop not connected: user selects affected listings manually → conservative $-risk estimate (price × sales velocity guess × “delist probability”).

If shop connected later: pull actual listings & sales to estimate impact automatically.

Email/Slack Notifications

Templates by severity; batched digests.

Multi-platform coverage

Start: Etsy.

Add: Amazon, eBay, Shopify.

Nice-to-have after v1:

Keyword watcher for policy pages (alert only when sections with “fees,” “prohibited,” “VAT,” “ads” change).

Role-based access for teams or agencies.

API/Webhook for partners.
